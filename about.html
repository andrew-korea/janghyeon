      <h1>Hello.</h1>
      <h2>
        My name is Jang Hyeon, Choi. I am currently a final year computer
        science student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my term will
        end in May.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a passion in machine learning and have experience with using
        Python. I have familiarized myself with handling not only open-source
        datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR, but also a real-world dataset.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have only spent six years in South Korea and the remaining years in
        other parts of the world, including, but not limited to, China, Brazil,
        and Zimbabwe. Embracing a multitude of languages and cultures in a
        foreign environment has kept me open-minded, leaving room for creativity
        and allowing me to tackle problems from different perspectives.
        <br />
        <br />
        The way-of-thinking and values that I have developed growing up as a
        Third Culture Kid will stay with me and continue to help me in various
        aspects in life.
